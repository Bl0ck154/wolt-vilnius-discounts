# Wolt Vilnius discounts

Public Wolt web endpoint research plus a small scheduled monitor for Vilnius discounts.
It does not depend on the old project files.

## Findings

The Wolt web page `https://wolt.com/en/ltu/vilnius/promotions-near-you` calls:

```text
GET https://consumer-api.wolt.com/v1/pages/venue-list/promotions-near-you?lon=25.2682558&lat=54.6901231
```

Required header:

```text
Platform: Web
```

Without `Platform: Web`, the endpoint still returns HTTP 200, but the body is `no-content`.
With `Platform: Web`, it returns a `venue-vertical-list` section with venues that have offer fields.

Useful JSON paths:

```text
Venue list: sections[0].items[*].venue
Offer data: sections[0].items[*].venue.promotions[*]
UI badge data: sections[0].items[*].venue.badges_v2[*]
Telemetry-only offers: sections[0].items[*].venue.promotions_for_telemetry[*]
```

For `lukiskiu-kalejimas-20`, the promo endpoint includes:

```json
{
  "campaign_id": "69c5251b0c0b699093092ff2",
  "icon": "coupon-fill",
  "is_offer_stackable": false,
  "text": "2.50 EUR off",
  "variant": "discount"
}
```

The actual API text uses the euro symbol and a narrow non-breaking space; the text above is normalized for readability.

The venue page also has a lightweight dynamic endpoint for one venue:

```text
GET https://consumer-api.wolt.com/order-xp/web/v1/venue/slug/lukiskiu-kalejimas-20/dynamic/?lat=54.6901231&lon=25.2682558&selected_delivery_method=homedelivery
```

Useful JSON path:

```text
Venue banner offers: venue.banners[*].discount.formatted_text
```

For this venue it returns normalized banner texts equivalent to `2.50 EUR off`, `0 EUR delivery for new users`, and `0 EUR delivery fee`.

## Run

```bash
npm run check
```

Target venue plus dynamic endpoint check:

```bash
npm run target
```

Custom slug:

```bash
node src/wolt-promotions-poc.mjs --slug caffeine-gedimino-pr --dynamic
```

No package install is required. The script only uses Node's built-in `fetch`.

## GitHub Actions

The workflow in `.github/workflows/check-discounts.yml` runs on a fixed cron schedule.
There is no random sleep inside the script.

The Wolt check job intentionally runs on a self-hosted runner instead of a
GitHub-hosted runner:

```yaml
runs-on: [self-hosted, Linux, X64, wolt]
```

Reason: Wolt currently returns `429 Too Many Requests` from GitHub-hosted runner
IP ranges even with browser-like headers and retry/backoff. The self-hosted
runner uses a server/IP that is accepted by Wolt.

Useful GitHub-side checks:

```bash
gh api repos/Bl0ck154/wolt-vilnius-discounts/actions/runners \
  --jq '.runners[] | {name,status,busy,labels:[.labels[].name]}'

gh workflow run "Check Wolt discounts" --repo Bl0ck154/wolt-vilnius-discounts --ref main
gh run list --repo Bl0ck154/wolt-vilnius-discounts --workflow "Check Wolt discounts" --limit 5
```

Before changing the runner/server, verify Wolt works from that machine:

```bash
curl -i 'https://consumer-api.wolt.com/v1/pages/venue-list/promotions-near-you?lon=25.2682558&lat=54.6901231' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json, text/plain, */*' \
  -H 'Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9' \
  -H 'Platform: Web' \
  -H 'Referer: https://wolt.com/' \
  -H 'User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/126 Safari/537.36'
```

Expected result is HTTP `200` with JSON. HTTP `429` means the server/IP is not a
good runner for this checker.

Required repository secrets for Telegram notifications:

```text
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID
```

Optional repository variables:

```text
MIN_DISCOUNT_EUR=3
MIN_DISCOUNT_PERCENT=20
INCLUDE_ZERO_DELIVERY=false
```

The checker writes:

```text
docs/data/latest.json
docs/data/changes.json
docs/data/changes-log.json
docs/data/notified-offers.json
```

GitHub Pages is deployed by `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml` from the `docs/` folder.
The workflow also redeploys after a successful discount check so Telegram and
the public dashboard use the same data snapshot.
